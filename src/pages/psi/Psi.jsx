        <p>
          In Eclipse Phase, psi is considered a special cognitive condition resulting from infection by the mutant—and hopefully otherwise benign—Watts-MacLeod strain of the exsurgent virus. This plague modifies the victim's mind, conferring special abilities. These abilities are inherent to the brain's architecture and are copied when the mind is uploaded, allowing the character to retain their psi abilities when changing from morph to morph.

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
          To wield psi, a character must acquire the Psi trait during character creation. It is theoretically also possible to acquire the use of psi in game via infection by the Watts-MacLeod strain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psi ability is considered an innate ability of the ego and not a biological or genetic predisposition of the morph. While psi researchers do not understand how it is possible to transfer this ability via uploads, backups, and farcasting, it has been speculated that all components of an async's ego are entangled on a quantum level or that they possess the ability to entangle themselves or form a unique conformation or alignment as a whole even after they have been copied, up-, or downloaded. This speculated entanglement process is also thought to be the origin of the impairment that asyncs experience when adapting to a new morph (see below).

        <h2>Morphs and Psi</h2>
        <p>
          Asyncs require a biological brain to draw on their abilities (the brains of uplifted animals count). An async whose ego is downloaded into an infomorph or fully computerized brain (synthmorphs) has no access to their abilities as long they remain in that morph.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asyncs inhabiting a pod morph may use psi, but their abilities are restricted as pod brains are only partly biological. Pod-morphed asyncs suffer a -30 modifier on all tests involving the use of psi sleights and the strain from using sleights is doubled.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Morph Acclimatization</h2>
        <p>
          Async minds undergo extra difficulty adjusting to new morphs. For 1 day after the character has resleeved, they will suffer the effects of a single derangement. The gamemaster and player should choose a derangement appropriate to the character and story. Minor derangements are recommended, but at the gamemaster's discretion moderate or major derangements may be applied. No trauma is inflicted with this derangement.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Morph Fever</h2>
        <p>
          Asyncs find it irritating and traumatizing to endure life as an infomorph, pod, or synthmorph for long periods of time. This phenomenon, known as morph fever, might cause temporary derangements and trauma to the asyncs' ego, possibly even to the grade of permanent disorders. If stored or held captive as an active infomorph (i.e., not in virtual stasis), the async might go insane if not psychologically aided by some sort of anodyne program or supporting person during storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In game terms, asyncs take 1d10 ÷ 2 (round up) points of mental stress damage per month they stay in a pod, synthmorph or infomorph form without psychological assistance by a psychiatrist, software, or muse.

        <h2>Psi Drawbacks</h2>
        <p>
          There are several drawbacks to psi ability:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc">
          <li>
            The variant exsurgent strain that endows psi ability rewires the character's brain. An unfortunate side effect to this change is that asyncs acquire a vulnerability to mental stress. Reduce the async's Trauma Threshold by 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            The mental instability that accompanies psi infection also tends to unhinge the character's mind. Asyncs acquires one Mental Disorder negative trait, for each level they have of the Psi trait without receiving any bonus CP. The gamemaster and player should agree on a disorder appropriate to the character. This disorder may be treated over time, according to normal rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Characters with the Psi trait are also vulnerable to infection by other strains of the exsurgent virus. The character suffers a -20 modifier when resisting exsurgent infection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Critical failures when using psi tend to stress the async's mind. Each time a critical failure is rolled when making a sleight-related test, the async suffers a temporary brain seizure. They suffer a -30 modifier and are incapable of acting until the end of the next Action Turn. They must also succeed in a WIL + COG Test or fall down.
          </li>
        </ul>
        
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Psi Skills and Sleights</h2>
        <p>
          Transhuman psi users can manipulate their egos and otherwise create effects that often cannot be matched or mimicked by technological means. To use these abilities, they train their mental processes and practice cognitive algorithms called sleights, which they can subconsciously recall and use as necessary. Sleights fall into two categories: psi-chi (cognitive enhancements) and psi-gamma (brainwave reading and manipulation). Psi-chi sleights are available to anyone with the Psi trait, but psi-gamma sleights are only available to characters with the Psi trait at Level 2. In order to use these sleights, the async must be skilled in the Control, Psi Assault, and/or Sense skills, as appropriate to each sleight.
        </p>

        <h2>Roleplaying Asyncs</h2>
        <p>
          Any player who chooses to play an async should keep the origin of their abilities in mind: Watts-MacLeod strain infection. The character may not be aware of this source, but they undoubtedly know that they underwent some sort of transformation and have talents that no one else does. If unaware of the infection, they have likely learned to keep their abilities secret lest they be ridiculed, attacked, or whisked away to some secret testing program. Learning the truth about their nature could even be the starting point of a campaign and/or their introduction to Firewall. If they know the truth, however, the character must live with the fact that they are the victim of a nanoplague likely spread by the TITANs that may or may not lead to complications, side effects, or other unexpected revelations in their future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gamemasters and players should make an effort to explore the nature of this infection and how the character perceives it. As noted previously, asyncs are often profoundly changed people. The invasive and alien aspect of their abilities should not be lost on them. For example, an async might conceive of their psi talents as a sort of parasitic entity, living off their sleights, or they might feel that using these powers puts them in touch with some sort of fundamental substrate of the universe that is weird and terrifying. Alternately, they could feel as if their personality was melded with something different, something that doesn't belong. Each async is likely to view their situation differently—and none of them pleasantly.
