      <p>
        Almost all technology in Eclipse Phase is designed to be operated via radio signals from the user's basic implant, although models usable by characters without basic implants are also available. In addition all devices contain a nearly microscopic computer and radio link (known as a “voice”) that allows the user to easily locate the object and that reports on the condition of the object or device, how to properly use and care for it, as well as telling the user when it needs to be repaired and how. Most are discrete and highly useful, but cheaply made goods sometimes have overly annoying voices.
      </p>

      <p>
        This means that almost all devices can be accessed via the mesh or directly if within radio range. This makes them vulnerable to hacking and intrusion attempts as well as radio jamming. Many devices are, however, publicly accessible. Meshed gear may also be tracked through the mesh. For privacy and security, these devices are often slaved to other systems (see Slaving Devices); devices worn/carried by characters are usually made part of the personal area network and slaved to the character's mesh inserts/ecto. For more info on meshed devices, see the Mesh chapter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many devices come equipped with AIs, who are equipped with skillsofts that enable them to operate the device on their own, as according to voiced instructions or commands issued through the net.

        <h2>Radio and Sensor Ranges</h2>

        <p>
          In Eclipse Phase, almost all devices are equipped with small radios so that they may be meshed. Likewise, many pieces of gear are equipped with sensors such as cameras, microphones, or other detectors. The Radio and Sensor Ranges table notes what range these devices operate at.

        <h2>Power</h2>
        <p>
          All of the powered devices in Eclipse Phase require electricity to function. With rare exceptions, most of them rely on solar cells, wireless energy transfers, or powerful batteries. Standard batteries are high-density, room-temperature superconductors with 25 times the capacity of the best batteries in common use in the early 21st century. Such batteries may also be constructed so that they are flexible, printed on devices, or woven into fabric. They are good for 100-500 hours of use and will alert the user when they run low.
        </p>
        <p>
          More powerful radio-isotope nuclear batteries are also available, heavily shielded so they do not emit radiation and good for 3 years or more of use. Nuclear and standard batteries are often included together, with the former recharging the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, power should rarely be an issue in Eclipse Phase games, unless it happens to fit the plot. Power failure could also result from a critical failure roll.
