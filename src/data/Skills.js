Seamless translation software is available for most human languages, but there are many languages that died out before anyone bothered writing a translator. In addition to unusual spoken languages (e.g., extinct Native American languages), a number of rare sign languages existed among isolated populations who either had large numbers of deaf people (e.g., Martha’s Vineyard, Al-Sayyid Bedouins) or taboos against speaking (e.g., the Australian Warlpiri, Trappist monks). These languages, or variations on them, are sometimes used by covert groups concerned about communication security. Linguistic isolates are favored, as these leave fewer clues for would-be translators. The whistles, clicks, and ultrasonic burst-pulses of the neo-cetacean language also fall in this category, primarily because the ability to speak and perceive it is beyond the physiology of standard transhumans. Transhumans with enhanced hearing can hear neo-cetacean, and those with echolocation implants can “speak” it, albeit poorly.
