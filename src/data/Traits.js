The patron should be an occasional help (probably no more than once per game session at most) but is not always at the character’s beck-and-call.

    details: 'For biomorphs, this radical alteration enables the subject’s metabolism to live off solar energy, using medichines to repair radiation damage. This same metabolism also generates powerful electro-magnetic fields that protect the character from the intense temperatures and radiation in the coronal environment and even enable the char- acter to sail the solar winds. Morphs with this adaptation cannot survive outside the coronal environment (or similar environments) for more than a few days without extensive medical support. Coronal adaptation can only be applied to morphs that also have medichines (p. 308, EP). For synthmorphs, this adaptation restructures the morph’s composition with heat-resistant materials capable of surviving superheated plasma and shielded against radiation. The shell is also equipped with refractive metamaterials and a perfectly mirrored surface, giving it an albedo of nearly one. The reflective surface protects the wearer from well over 99% of the radiant energy that falls upon it, but a powerful cooling system and extensive radiation shielding are required for the minuscule percentage of energy that slips through. Generated electromagnetic fields also protect the morph and enable propulsion along solar magnetic lines. This adaptation provides a +10 modifier to the biomorph’s Free Fall skill tests in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields.

The morph’s cyberbrain and mesh access still work in these circumstances, but the morph cannot physically move under its own power. Even if placed back in higher temperatures, if it was previously reduced to total immobility, the morph halves its COO and SOM (round down) until it has been serviced.

For every three months of game time, the character must spend credits equal to 10% the cost of the morph on GSP “upgrades.” If they fail to do so, the morph’s SOM is reduced by 5 until the character gets their GSP therapy. These penalties are cumulative over time (at 6 months, 9 months, etc.), but getting GSP therapy once removes all penalties. The character suffers no SOM loss if the majority of a given 3 month period was spent in hibernation, in a healing vat, or in some other form of metabolic suspension. The SOM reduction is due to low level neural degradation, minor tumors, joint pain, and other problems that crop up and express later as hypercorp genetic designers working on tight budgets and tighter deadlines race to release morph models with extra value-added features. While theoretically over many years this trait would lead to the early death of the morph, in game terms the morph stops accruing penalties when its SOM is reduced to 5. The character regains their normal SOM score if they resleeve. This trait is only available to biomorphs (including uplifts and pods)',

    details: 'It is an impressive feat that creatures that evolved on separate worlds with different biochemistries are now being transformed into pods by transhuman geneticists. In fact, the biochemistries of these creatures are far less understood than that of transhumans. What this means is that drugs, chemicals, bioware augmentations, and cybernetic implants may have unpredictable effects on the pod. Drug treatments beneficial to transhumans may not function at all, for example, while something that transhumans regularly eat or handle may in fact be toxic to the pod and trigger an anaphylactic response. The gamemaster decides when this factor will play a role, based on the pod biochemistry’s similarity to that of transhumans and numerous other factors. Certain augmentations may simply not be available, having not yet been invented for the alien physiology in question. While efforts have been made to provide these pods with their equivalent of basic biomods, the full protections offered by those enhancements may simply not be available. This means that the pod may or may not be vulnerable to such things as disease, aging, lack of sleep, long-term exposure to microgravity, shock from injuries, allergies, or other biological problems that transhumanity has attempted to eradicate. Likewise, the pod might not be able to heal quickly or regenerate limbs. It is also possible that the pod may be burdened with unusual biological problems inherent to its species, such as bizarre gastrointestinal issues, hacking up hairballs, respiratory distress, or an alien version of leukemia. Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive. Morphs with alien biochemistry count as exotic and inflict –30 modifiers to Alienation and Integrity Tests (p. 272, EP).
