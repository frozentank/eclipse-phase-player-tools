        description: 'Commonly used for criminal rehabilitation, behavioral control attempts to limit, block, or expunge a specific behavior from the subject\'s psyche',
        details: 'Commonly used for criminal rehabilitation, behavioral control attempts to limit, block, or expunge a specific behavior from the subject\'s psyche. For example, a murderer may be conditioned against acts of aggression or a kleptomaniac might be restricted from stealing. Some people seek this adjustment willingly, such as socialite glitterati who restrict their desire to eat or an addict who cuts out their craving for a fix. Behavioral control can also be applied as an unleashing or reinforcement. A companion may desire to eliminate their sexual inhibitions, for example, or a hypercorp exec may boost their commitment to place work above all else. A character will simply feel compelled to avoid a behavior that is limited (perhaps suffering a -10 modifier), but will find it quite difficult to pursue a behavior that is blocked (requiring a WIL × 3 Test and suffering a -20 modifier). They will find themselves completely incapable of initiating a behavior that is expunged and if forced into the behavior will suffer a -30 modifier and (1d10 ÷ 2, round up) points of mental Stress. Likewise, a character will feel compelled to pursue a behavior that is boosted and will find it hard to avoid engaging in a behavior that is encouraged (requiring a WIL × 3 Test to avoid). They will have no choice but to engage in enforced behaviors and will suffer (1d10 ÷ 2, round up) points of mental Stress if prevented from doing so.',

Memory storage is complex and diffused, however, and often linked to other memories, so removing one memory may affect others (gamemaster discretion).

Even when successfully implanted, fake memories may clash with other (real) memories unless those are also erased.',
