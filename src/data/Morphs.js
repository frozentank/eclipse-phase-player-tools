Whiplash pods are gaining some traction among gatecrashers due to their ability to blend in to arboreal environments. The primary modification made to the whiplash stock was to turn the entire organism upside down and orient the digestive portion of the organism horizontally, so that the whiplash\'s trilobed orifice faces forward. The whiplash\'s grasping roots were also converted into even more motile “walking tentacles” borrowed from other Sunrise planimals. Other adjustments include the addition of a pair of grasping limbs, each with four universally opposable digits; artificial sensing mods (providing transhuman-standard sensing ability); and a general toughening of the internal structure for rigidity and support. The barrel-like body remains very similar to the original planimal stock and, reorientation notwithstanding, the digestive system remains mostly unchanged. The ability to extend and retract the whiplash\'s feeding tendril was heavily enhanced, so now the tendril acts more like a two-meter-long chameleon-like tongue than a hanging food-trap.',

Like suryas, salamanders communicate either via wireless transmissions or by “sunspotting”—using their chromatophores to shift light and dark patterns on their skin to form patterns easily comprehensible to other coronal morphs. Salamanders have a wiry, streamlined, swept-back sort of look, a combination of fey and monkey-like. Their heads are also somewhat reptilian, with reflective eyes, no nose, and no mouth. Their feet are prehensile, usable just like hands. They lack reproductive organs and capabilities and feature cyberware gas jets on their chest and back for maneuvering in zero g.

    details: 'Another creation by the mad geniuses of the exoplanet Fortean, this morph is a modified version of a resurrected species. The extinct Tyto Pollens was a large pre-Columbian flightless ground owl species in the Caribbean. The chickcharnie was rumored to be a supernatural variant of this bird that haunted the forests bestowing boons or curses upon travelers depending on how they treated it. The Fortean version of the chickcharnie is best described as a humanoid owl. Over one meter in height, it is bipedal but stands shorter than humans. Though winged, it is flightless except in very low grav environments and microgravity. Its wing design, however, incorporates a functional set of clawed hands. The chickcharnie is growing in popularity among neo-avians who don\'t mind sacrificing flight for physical resilience, more functional hands, and a stature closely approximating transhuman standards.',

Many primate uplifts choose hypergibbons in place of other pods or when they need something small like a neotenic. Hypergibbons stand about 1 meter tall, weigh 15 kilograms, and typically have black fur and skin (although bodysculpting permits many variations). They have inflatable throat sacks that allow melodious calls that carry great distances. Their wrists feature a ball-and-socket joint and also naturally dislocate to enable easier swinging by the arms.',

    details: 'Many leaders want to ensure loyalty or at least obedience from their citizens, especially recently sleeved infugees. The freeman biomorph offers rulers (some would say tyrants or dictators) a chance to offer citizens a new life without worrying about dissidence. Based on the splicer morph, the freeman is genetically modified to be more obedient, which results in lower Willpower. More insidiously, freeman morphs are genetically modified with a protein that makes their neurons sensitive to light. When combined with an optogenetics module implant, these neurons can be activated and deactivated remotely, enabling a monitoring muse or meshed overseer to control the ego\'s behavior. (The specific behavior affected is chosen with each optogenetics module implant.) The freeman comes with a specialized monitor AGI installed in a modified ghostrider module. The monitor, usually a modified fork of the tyrant\'s muse, watches and reports all suspicious actions taken by the primary ego. The purpose of this implant is often concealed. Citizens who sleeve into a freeman morph are told the implant is a security measure that helps prevent infection from TITAN technology or some similar lie. The module is designed to resist tampering and will report to headquarters the instant it detects a hacker\'s intrusion. The monitor muse can manipulate the ego\'s behavior or even take control of the morph via its puppet sock, but avoids doing that unless absolutely necessary. Dictators do not want to reveal that their citizens have spies implanted in their skulls, watching them. Surprisingly, some people voluntarily sleeve into freeman morphs, preferring to hand responsibility and decision-making over to other parties, such as the Sendero Luminoso Benevolent Dictatorship habitat in the Neptunian Trojans.',

Each rover is 0.6 meters in diameter and, with its limbs retracted, has the ominous appearance of a reflective, shiny, black globe. It can extrude three arms, each with a built-in weapon: extendable claws, a small laser, and a heavy rail pistol loaded with 200 rounds of ammunition. Rovers are stealthy and highly maneuverable and so favored for bodyguard and police purposes in some areas. They are often deployed via remote control.',

Its medichines and nanophages keep the morph protected from most attacks by exsurgent nanotech, and the lack of a cyberbrain makes it less vulnerable to mind hacking.
