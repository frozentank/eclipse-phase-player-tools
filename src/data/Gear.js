        details: 'Almost universal in biomorphs, many habitats will not allow individuals to visit/immigrate if their biomorph does not possess these biomods in order to preserve public health. Basic biomods consists of a series of genetic tweaks, tailored viruses, and bacteria that speed healing, greatly increase disease resistance, and impede aging. A morph with basic biomods heals twice as fast as an early 21st century human, gradually regrows lost body parts, is immune to all normal diseases (from cancer to the flu), and is largely immune to aging. In addition, the morph requires no more than 3–4 hours of sleep per night, is immune to ill effects from long-term exposure to low or zero gravity, and does not naturally suffer from biological problems like depression, shock reactions after being injured, or allergies',

It manages the user’s augmented reality input and can run any software the character desires (see Software, p. 331). It also processes XP data, allowing the user to experience other people’s recorded memories, and also allowing the user to share their own XP sensory input with others in real-time. Facial/image recognition and encryption software are included by default.',

        details: 'A cortical stack is a tiny cyberware data storage unit protected within a synthdiamond case the size of a grape, implanted at the base of the skull where the brain stem and spinal cord connect. It contains a digital backup of that character’s ego. Part nanoware, the implant maintains a network of nanobots that monitor synaptic connections and brain architecture, noting any changes and updating the ego backup in real time, right up to the moment of death. If the character dies, the cortical stack can be recovered and they may be restored from the backup (see Resleeving). Cortical stacks do not have external or wireless access (for security), they must be surgically removed (see Retrieving a Cortical Stack). Cortical stacks are extremely durable, requiring special effort to damage or destroy. They are commonly recovered from bodies that have otherwise been pulped or mangled. Cortical stacks are intentionally isolated from mesh inserts and other implants, as a security measure to prevent hacking or external tampering.',

Only one ego or AI may “inhabit” a cyberbrain at a time; to accommodate extras, mesh inserts or a ghostrider module must be used. Since cyberbrains store memories digitally, they have the equivalent of mnemonic augmentation. They also have a built-in puppet sock and may be remote-controlled, though this option may be removed by those who value their security. Cyberbrains are vulnerable to cyberbrain hacking and other forms of electronic infiltration/ attack. Cyberbrains come equipped with two or more pairs of external access jacks, usually located at the base of the skull, which allow for direct wired connections.',

Characters with this augmentation can always retrace any route they have taken, only experiencing difficulty with three-dimensional routes lacking navigational markers (such as deep space or undersea; apply a –30 modifier).

However, they can only remember things to which they paid attention.

        details: 'The character’s brain is intentionally partitioned to accommodate an extra personality. This multiplicity is not viewed as a disorder, but as a cognitive tool to help people deal with their hypercomplex environments. This extra personality can be an NPC run by the gamemaster, a separate character (in ego form only) made by the player, or the downloaded fork of another character. For all intents and purposes, the extra personality is treated as a separate ego (i.e., it may fork separately), except that both personalities are backed up in the same cortical stack and if downloaded they must be placed in separate morphs or in another morph with this implant. Only one ego may be in control of the morph at a time. The other resides in the background, still active, but not on a surface level. Each ego is completely aware of what the other is doing, thinking, etc. If for some reason the subsumed personality wants to come to the fore, but the other personality won’t relinquish control, make an Opposed WIL × 3 Test. Each ego has its own Lucidity and Trauma Threshold, and they track stress and trauma separately. Any psi attacks or social/mental influences only affect the personality at the fore. Having an extra ego in your head, working in the background, is helpful for multitasking. The character receives an extra Complex Action each turn that may only be used for mental or mesh actions.',
