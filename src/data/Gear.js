A morph with basic biomods heals twice as fast as an early 21st century human, gradually regrows lost body parts, is immune to all normal diseases (from cancer to the flu), and is largely immune to aging. In addition, the morph requires no more than 3–4 hours of sleep per night, is immune to ill effects from long-term exposure to low or zero gravity, and does not naturally suffer from biological problems like depression, shock reactions after being injured, or allergies',

Cortical stacks do not have external or wireless access (for security), they must be surgically removed (see Retrieving a Cortical Stack). Cortical stacks are extremely durable, requiring special effort to damage or destroy. They are commonly recovered from bodies that have otherwise been pulped or mangled.

The high cost of this implant also covers the cost of this storage. Using standard radio and quantum encryption, the farcaster broadcasts full backups of the character’s ego (pulled from the cortical stack) once every 48 hours. At the gamemaster’s discretion, the backup interval may be scheduled more or less frequently, keeping in mind that ego broadcasts are generally limited for security purposes and because they hog bandwidth. These broadcasts only work when the character is in radio contact with the storage facility and is typically only used inside a habitat to broadcast backups back to a nearby space ship. If the radio broadcasts are blocked or jammed, this device cannot make backups. In the event of a farcaster failure, this augmentation also includes a single-use emergency neutrino broadcaster (p. 314) as well. This broadcaster contains approximately 10 nanograms of antimatter stored in an orange-sized triply redundant magnetic containment vessel. If the character is dying or urgently wishes to depart the morph, this tiny amount of antimatter is brought into contact with a similarly tiny amount of matter in a controlled fashion that generates a single brief and carefully coded neutrino pulse of the ego’s most recent backup. However, the heat generated by this process literally cooks the entire morph, killing it and destroying all implants and electronics in or on it. This entire process takes less than 0.1 second and the broadcast can be received as long as the neutrino receiver is within 100 astronomical units of the character. Within the solar system, this implant effectively guarantees the character’s backup. It is less useful on exoplanets where the character is out of neutrino range of their backup facility. The amount of antimatter carried by this implant is sufficiently small enough that it does not produce an explosion and will not damage any surrounding objects. Most habitats carefully scan all visitors to determine if they have this implant and if the amounts of antimatter involved are sufficiently low as not to pose a danger to the habitat and its inhabitants, and some ban this implant entirely.',

With the exception of a few exceptionally deadly nanoplagues, a healing vat can cure any disease and heal any injury. As long as the patient is alive when they are place in the healing vat, they will not only survive, but emerge without a scratch. A healing vat can even take a severed head (as long as it has been stabilized by medichines or nanotech first aid) and regrow an entire body based on the head’s genetics. If the patient’s body or medical records contain information about their implants, bioware, or advanced nanotechnology, all of these modifications are also fully restored. Few people suffer injuries serious enough to require a healing vat. Most are used as a safe and easy way to perform bodysculpting or to install implants or bioware. Healing vats use specialized nanomachines to either alter the patient’s body or integrate implants or bioware. One advantage of using a healing vat is that no additional healing time is needed, the patient leaves the vat fully recovered from the augmentation and ready to go. Every hospital, clinic, bodyshop, and augmentation parlor has several healing vats. The time required by a healing vat varies with the severity of the damage it is healing or the extent of the modification being made, as noted on the Healing Vat table, p. 327.',
